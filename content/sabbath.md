Sacred Rhythms are wired into the fabric of the universe. That's what we learn midway through the first creation story in Genesis 1:1â€“2:3. At the very end, we see God bless the seventh day and set it apart from the rest of the days. He makes the seventh day holy.

On the seventh day, the Sabbath, God rests from his work of creation. But the word rest here isn't like God climbed into a hammock or a hot tub after a long day of gardening. Rather, God is setting up a throne. 

Sabbath is all about God being king over the whole world. The invitation he offers is to participation in the rest that stems from God's good rule. In resting one day out of the seven, we admit that God is the source of all life and that we are dependent on him. We acknowledge that he is the one who ultimately sustains us.

In these short readings, we'll meditate once again on the first creation story, and then revisit Leviticus to see how Sabbath is wired into the festivals of Israel.
