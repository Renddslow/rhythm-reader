The vision of sacred rhythms in the Scriptures reaches a fever pitch when we reach the Sabbath year and the year of Jubilee. It's as if, up to this point, we'd been hovering just above the ground, still very comfortable knowing that the ground was just beneath our feet. We celebrate holidays like Christmas and Easter, we have daily rhythms like brushing our teeth. But suddenly, the Bible brings us to these strange rhythms that the people of God would have only ever experienced a handful of times in their lives. 

Suddenly, we are rocketed into the stratosphere. Our categories get blown up, we have nothing to compare this to.

In the Sabbath year, the land is meant to rest. For us, a community that is largely very urban, it can be easy to have a disconnect with the agrarian culture of the ancient world. If the Israelites wanted to eat in the Sabbath year, it meant they needed to save up food every year prior. Not only that, any hired hands they had among them throughout the previous years were to be set free. Every seven years, on the Sabbath year, Israel was supposed to experience a mini reset.

This vision wasn't just about you though. It was about the poor fellow Israelite who in a desperate situation, sold himself to your family as an indentured slave, so he could continue to feed his family when his land stopped producing crops. All of a sudden, he is free. He's his own man.

Now things get crazier on the year of Jubilee. The Jubilee was meant for the seventh Sabbath year (the seventh, seven). In that year, just like Sabbath years, slaves were set free, and the land was given rest. But more than that, anyone in Israel who had needed to sell his ancestral land for any reason suddenly had that property restored.

This was a total reset.

In the Sabbath Year and the Year of Jubilee, the people of God experience a real, tangible, substantive shift in their economics, their society, and their land. And the shift was a shift back—if even for one year only—to the Garden of Eden.
