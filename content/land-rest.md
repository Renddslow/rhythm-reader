In the traditional Hebrew ordering of the Old Testament—the way Jesus would've likely grown up reading his Bible—Chronicles is the last book. Chronicles ends tragically, but with a bittersweet note drawing our minds back to the messianic hope begun in Genesis 3:15.

2 Chronicles 36 traces the fall of Jerusalem to the empire of Babylon in 587 BCE. This was a turning point in Israel's story, perhaps the most important since the Red Sea. The story had been told by the prophets repeatedly, starting with warnings in Deuteronomy, then being told in narrative in Kings, and finally being one of the chief subjects of Isaiah–Malachi. You start to hear the story told and retold so many times that you may think Chronicles is just retreading the same well-worn ground.

But at the very end of the exile story, Chronicles adds this small piece of information, this additional word that should really make us ponder: "The land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of YHWH spoken by Jeremiah."

There were a myriad reasons why YHWH had allowed the exile to happen. Unfaithfulness, injustice, apostasy, idolatry, and so on. But _the land_ had vomited Israel out (cf. Lev 18:28) because they had not observed the Sabbath Years and the Year of Jubilee.
