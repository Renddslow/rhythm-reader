The _Torah_ comprise the first five books of the Bible. If we count them from the outside books inwards, we would find the book of Leviticus at the center.

At the literary center of the book of Leviticus are a set of instructions, rationale, and practices around one particular event: the day of atonement (Lev 16). Often in Hebrew literature, when there is a distinct center, it tends to be the central idea—even the climax—of a particular literary unit. In this case, Leviticus 16 serves to show what this whole project of _Torah_ has been about. It's about the forgiveness of sin and the reconciliation of God and humanity and of heaven and earth. 

In a similar fashion, we see another atonement in the Matthew reading this week. Jesus' atoning death would become the central narrative and focus of the entire Bible.
