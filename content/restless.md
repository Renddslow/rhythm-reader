The opening movement of the book of Genesis is divided into two parts: Adam–Noah (Genesis 1–5), and Noah–Abraham (Genesis 6–11). We'll begin our reading for this series in the very first part of the very first movement of the Bible.

In this part, we get one story that is bookended by the idea of rest. As you saw in the videos, creation has baked into it the rhythms of festivals, celebration, and rest. But the tragedy of the first movement of Genesis is that human forfeit this gift of rest by choosing to define good and bad on their own terms. As a result, they no longer experience rest, but are produce food and children through "painful toil."

Typically, this story, with its subtle hope of the Messiah (checkout Genesis 3:15) is thought to end here. The story of Cain and Abel and the genealogies get skipped over. But they are _crucially_ important.

In the Hebrew Bible, genealogies are always reminding us that we are looking for a Descendant (or seed) of the woman. In the case of the genealogy in Genesis 5, we conclude the part by being told that perhaps Noah (whose name means "rest") will bring relief from "painful toil." 

The opening five chapters of the Bible present us with the design for rest, and a coming hope of future rest. Lets see how it all plays out.
