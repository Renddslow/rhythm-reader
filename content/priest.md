We mentioned that the priestly duty was one of daily forgiveness and purification that invited the people of God into God's own life-giving presence. But the reality was, this experience was mediated by God's anointed priests. This made sense, the Israelites had decided _not_ to go up on Mount Sinai to receive their ordination as royal priests, so instead, God set up a representational system.

But the promise of Genesis 3 is that everything would be set right again by a priest who would be victorious by suffering and that God's blessing would once again flow freely to the whole world.

So who is that priest?
