Over the course of Israel's history, its relationship with the Sabbath became strange. Sometimes they would go through cycles of ignoring it or begrudgingly keeping it. By the time of Jesus, some religious leaders had attempted to make the commands of the Torah easy on the average person. In doing so, they set up a series of rules and guidelines for what sorts of action were appropriate on the Sabbath.

It is into this milieu that Jesus enters, seeking to bring the _shalom_ of God's Kingdom to people on the Sabbath day. In Jesus' mind, this is just the sort of work that ought to be done on the Sabbath.

As you read this, consider what it means that Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath. How do we relate to the Sabbath and to rest in light of Jesus' ministry of _shalom_?
