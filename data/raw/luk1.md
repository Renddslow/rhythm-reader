“My soul exalts the Lord,
>> {47} And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
{48} For He has had regard for the humble state of His bond-servant;
>> For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed.
{49} For the Mighty One has done great things for me;
>> And holy is His name.
{50} And His mercy is to generation after generation
>> Toward those who fear Him.
{51} He has done mighty deeds with His arm;
>> He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
{52} He has brought down rulers from their thrones,
>> And has exalted those who were humble.
{53} He has filled the hungry with good things,
>> And sent the rich away empty-handed.
{54} He has given help to His servant Israel,
>> In remembrance of His mercy,
{55} Just as He spoke to our fathers,
>> To Abraham and his descendants forever.”
