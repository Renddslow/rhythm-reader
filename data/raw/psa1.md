{1} Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
>> Nor stand in the path of sinners,
>> Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
{2} But his delight is in the Law of the Lord,
>> And on His Law he meditates day and night.
{3} He will be like a tree planted by streams of water,
>> Which yields its fruit in its season,
And its leaf does not wither;
>> And in whatever he does, he prospers.

{4} The wicked are not so,
>> But they are like chaff which the wind blows away.
{5} Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
>> Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
{6} For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
>> But the way of the wicked will perish.
