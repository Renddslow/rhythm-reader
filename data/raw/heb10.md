{1} For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the form of those things itself, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually every year, make those who approach perfect. {2} Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins? {3} But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. {4} For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. {5} Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,

“You have not desired sacrifice and offering,
But You have prepared a body for Me;
{6} You have not taken pleasure in whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin.
{7} Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come
(It is written of Me in the scroll of the book)
To do Your will, O God.’”

---!p
{8} After saying above, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin You have not desired, nor have You taken pleasure in them” (which are offered according to the Law), {9} then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second. {10} By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.

{11} Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; {12} but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, {13} waiting from that time onward until His enemies are made a footstool for His feet. {14} For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. {15} And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,

{16} “This is the covenant which I will make with them
After those days, declares YHWH:
I will put My laws upon their hearts,
And write them on their mind,”

---!p
He then says,

---!q
{17} “And their sins and their lawless deeds
I will no longer remember.”

---!p
{18} Now where there is forgiveness of these things, an offering for sin is no longer required.

{19} Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, {20} by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, through His flesh, {21} and since we have a great priest over the house of God, {22} let’s approach God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. {23} Let’s hold firmly to the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; {24} and let’s consider how to encourage one another in love and good deeds, {25} not abandoning our own meeting together, as is the habit of some people, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.

{26} For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, {27} but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries. {28} Anyone who has ignored the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. {29} How much more severe punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? {30} For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay.” And again, “YHWH will judge His people.” {31} It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

{32} But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings, {33} partly by being made a public spectacle through insults and distress, and partly by becoming companions with those who were so treated. {34} For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting possession. {35} Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. {36} For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.

---!q
{37} For yet in a very little while,
He who is coming will come, and will not delay.
{38} But My righteous one will live by faith;
And if he shrinks back, My soul has no pleasure in him.

---!p
{39} But we are not among those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith for the safekeeping of the soul.
