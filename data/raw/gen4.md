{1} Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, “I have obtained a male child with the help of YHWH.” {2} And again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a cultivator of the ground. {3} So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to YHWH from the fruit of the ground. {4} Abel, on his part also brought an offering, from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions. And YHWH had regard for Abel and his offering; {5} but for Cain and his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his face was gloomy. {6} Then YHWH said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why is your face gloomy? {7} If you do well, will your face not be cheerful? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it.” {8} Cain talked to his brother Abel; and it happened that when they were in the field Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.

{9} Then YHWH said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” {10} Then He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground. {11} Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. {12} When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth.” {13} Cain said to YHWH, “My punishment is too great to endure! {14} Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and I will be hidden from Your face, and I will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” {15} So YHWH said to him, “Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him seven times as much.” And YHWH placed a mark on Cain, so that no one finding him would kill him.

{16} Then Cain left the presence of YHWH, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

{17} Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and Cain built a city, and named the city Enoch, after the name of his son. {18} Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. {19} Lamech took two wives for himself: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah. {20} Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and have livestock. {21} His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and flute. {22} As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

>> Listen to my voice,
> You wives of Lamech,
>> Pay attention to my words,
> For I have killed a man for wounding me;
>> And a boy for striking me!
> {24} If Cain is avenged seven times,
>> Then Lamech seventy-seven times!”

{25} Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for, she said, “God has appointed me another child in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” {26} To Seth also a son was born; and he named him Enosh. Then people began to call upon the name of YHWH.
