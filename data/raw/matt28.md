{1} Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb. {2} And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. {3} And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. {4} The guards shook from fear of him and became like dead men. {5} And the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified. {6} He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying. {7} And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see Him; behold, I have told you.”

{8} And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to report to His disciples. {9} And behold, Jesus met them and said, “Rejoice!” And they came up and took hold of His feet, and worshiped Him. {10} Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go, bring word to My brothers to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me.”

{11} Now while they were on their way, some of the men from the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. {12} And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, {13} and said, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came at night and stole Him while we were asleep.’ {14} And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will appease him and keep you out of trouble.” {15} And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews and is to this day.

{16} But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated to them. {17} And when they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful. {18} And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. {19} Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, {20} teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”
