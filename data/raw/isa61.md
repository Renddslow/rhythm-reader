> {1} The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,
>> Because the Lord anointed me
>> To bring good news to the humble;
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
>> To proclaim release to captives
>> And freedom to prisoners;
{2} To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord
>> And the day of vengeance of our God;
To comfort all who mourn,
>> {3} To grant those who mourn in Zion,
Giving them a garland instead of ashes,
>> The oil of gladness instead of mourning,
>> The cloak of praise instead of a disheartened spirit.
So they will be called oaks of righteousness,
>> The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.

{4} Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins,
>> They will raise up the former devastations;
And they will repair the ruined cities,
>> The desolations of many generations.
{5} Strangers will stand and pasture your flocks,
>> And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.
{6} But you will be called the priests of the Lord;
>> You will be spoken of as ministers of our God.
You will eat the wealth of nations,
>> And you will boast in their riches.
{7} Instead of your shame you will have a double portion,
>> And instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion.
Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land,
>> Everlasting joy will be theirs.
{8} For I, the Lord, love justice,
>> I hate robbery in the burnt offering;
And I will faithfully give them their reward,
>> And make an everlasting covenant with them.
{9} Then their offspring will be known among the nations,
>> And their descendants in the midst of the peoples.
All who see them will recognize them
>> Because they are the offspring whom the Lord has blessed.

{10} I will rejoice greatly in the Lord,
>> My soul will be joyful in my God;
For He has clothed me with garments of salvation,
>> He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness,
As a groom puts on a turban,
>> And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
{11} For as the earth produces its sprouts,
>> And as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up,
So the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise
>> To spring up before all the nations.
