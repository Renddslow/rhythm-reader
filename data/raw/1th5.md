{1} Now as to the periods and times, brothers and sisters, you have no need of anything to be written to you. {2} For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord is coming just like a thief in the night. {3} While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. {4} But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that the day would overtake you like a thief; {5} for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness; {6} so then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober. {7} For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night. {8} But since we are of the day, let’s be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation. {9} For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, {10} who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him. {11} Therefore, encourage one another and build one another up, just as you also are doing.

{12} But we ask you, brothers and sisters, to recognize those who diligently labor among you and are in leadership over you in the Lord, and give you instruction, {13} and that you regard them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another. {14} We urge you, brothers and sisters, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. {15} See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek what is good for one another and for all people. {16} Rejoice always, {17} pray without ceasing, {18} in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. {19} Do not quench the Spirit, {20} do not utterly reject prophecies, {21} but examine everything; hold firmly to that which is good, {22} abstain from every form of evil.

{23} Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. {24} Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will do it.

{25} Brothers and sisters, pray for us.

{26} Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss. {27} I put you under oath by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.

{28} May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
